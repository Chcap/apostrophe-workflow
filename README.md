## TODO

* Direct attachments have to be copied, not cross-referenced, otherwise edits to them will unexpectedly be shared.
* "Reorganize" operations must be attended to, in particular the impact on path and rank must be propagated as part of the commit process.
* The trash must be refactored so that pages don't lose their context in the tree while they are considered trash in some locales. Trash is just one more toggle-able flag that might get propagated as part of the commit process.
